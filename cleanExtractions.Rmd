This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(XLConnect)
library(stringr)
```

Read the Excel file (from copy initially)

```{r}
setwd("D://trackRetrievedArticles/")
## NB list sheets: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12945687/how-to-read-all-worksheets-in-an-excel-workbook-into-an-r-list-with-data-frame-e

wb <-loadWorkbook("scores_extraction.xlsx")
scores  <- readWorksheet(wb, sheet=getSheets(wb)[1])
```

The scores file has been read into an R data.frame 'scores'

```{r}
cutpoints <- str_replace(scores$definition_of_a_positive_test, ">=", "")
cutpoints <- str_trim(cutpoints, side = "both")

## TODO: replace multiple patterns using "|"?
cutpoints <- str_replace_all(scores$definition_of_a_positive_test, "[a-zA-Z]| >= | \\.", "")

write.csv(cbind(scores$definition_of_a_positive_test, cutpoints), file="scoresTest.csv")
```
